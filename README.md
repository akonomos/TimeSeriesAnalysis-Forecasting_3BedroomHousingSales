# TimeSeriesAnalysis-Forecasting_3BedroomHousingSales
This repository contains the code and data for a housing sales forecasting project leveraging time series analysis and Meta's Prophet. The project aims to predict housing prices over time, specifically focusing on 3-bedroom houses. The dataset spans from 2007 to 2019, and the forecast extends into 2020.

Time Series Analysis: My project heavily relies on time series analysis techniques to uncover trends, seasonality, and patterns in historical housing sales data.
Meta's Prophet Model: The forecasting model utilizes Meta's Prophet, a robust open-source tool for time series forecasting. Prophet is chosen for its ability to handle seasonality, holidays, and outliers effectively.
Quarterly Aggregation and Smoothing: The raw sales data is resampled at quarterly intervals, and a 4-step moving average smoothing technique is applied for a clearer representation of trends.

Please refer to main.py for my conclusions.
